===============================

1.2.0
-----

### Fixed a lot of issues and related features
* You can find issues and feature requests related to this release on our
  [roadmap](https://dev.icinga.org/versions/310)

### Permissions and restrictions
* Permissions are now enforced. Please check your role definitions, permission
  names have changed and are now enforced everywhere
* Configuration preview, Inspect action, Deployment and others can be granted
  independently

### Auditing
* Director provides a nice activity log. Now it is also possible to additionally
  log to Syslog or File in case you want to archive all actions elsewhere. Access
  to the audit log in the Director can be controlled with a new permission

### Configuration kickstart
* Now imports also existing notification commands
* Kickstart can be re-triggered on demand at any time

### Performance
* Config rendering got a huge performance boost. In large environments we
  managed it to deploy a real-world configuration 5 times as fast as before

### Import / Sync
* Various improvements have been applied, mostly hidden small features that should
  make work easier. Better form field descriptions, more possibilities when it
  goes to syncing special fields like "imports"
* Property modifiers can now generate new modified columns at import time
* New property modifiers are available. There is a pretty flexible DNS lookup, you
  can cast to Integer or Boolean, JSON decoding and more is offered
* Datalist entries can now be imported and synchronized, this was broken in 1.1

### Configuration possibilities
* You can now define assign rules nested as deep as you want, based on all host
  and/or service properties
* It is now possible to define "assign for" constructs, looping over hashes or
  dictionaries
* Improved Icinga 2 DSL support in commands, implicit support for skip\_key
* More and more developers are contributing code. We therefore simplified the
  way to launch our unit tests and provided related documentation
* Other objects can be referred as a dropdown or similar in custom variables

### GUI and usability
* Form error handling got a lot of tweaking, eventual exceptions are caught in
  various places and presented in a readable way
* The deployment button is now easier to find
* Configuration preview has been improved and allows a full config diff even
  before deploying the configuration
* Inheritance loops are now shown in a nice way and can be resolved in the GUI
* A new hidden gem is the multiedit functionality. Press SHIFT/CTRL while
  selecting multiple hosts and modify imports, custom vars and other properties
  for all of them at once
* Errors or warnings in all historic startup logs now link directly to the
  related config file at the time being, pointing to the referred line

### Agent setup
* The Windows kickstart script got some small improvements and now enables all
  related ITL commands per default

### CLI
* You can find a few new commands, with the ability to list or fetch all hosts
  at once in various ways being the most prominent one

### Related modules
* There are now more additional modules implementing Director Hooks. AWS import
  for EC2 instances, ELBs and Autoscaling Groups. File import for CSV, JSON,
  YAML and XML. We heard from various successful Import source implementations
  in custom projects and would love to see more of those being publicly available!

  Sync Runs.
