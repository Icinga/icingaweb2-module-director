===============================

Please make sure to always read our [Upgrading](05-Upgrading.md) documentation
before switching to a new version.

v1.10.2
-------

This is a minor bugfix release, addressing some Sync-related issues: purge for
objects with uppercase characters now works as expected, automated Sync jobs run
again, and manually triggered Sync has been fixed on PostgreSQL.

Some UI glitches have been addressed, and a few problems appearing only in
certain conditions - related to Configuration Baskets, our Self Service REST API
and the Activity Log.

### Fixed issues

v1.10.1
-------

This is a minor bugfix release, addressing issues with modifying services via
the monitoring module, Sync problems and a copy and paste error in the DB schema,
which caused problems for fresh installations since v1.10.

Please note that a long-standing issue for our Sync Rules has been fixed: with
"merge" policy, NULL properties have been ignored for quite some time. This has
now been fixed. If in doubt, please **preview** your Sync Rules to make sure,
that they behave as expected.

This release brings a small schema migration, cleaning up invalid Sync history
entries. If in doubt, please create a [database backup](05-Upgrading.md#backup-first) first.

v1.10.0
-------

An advanced **Sync Preview** is one of the features I'd love to highlight in
v1.10.0. We have been able to leverage our Configuration Branch support as
an underlying technology for this:

![Sync Preview - List](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553008/191472888-33849b3e-9d96-4113-b960-92708769e90d.png)

In case you have lots of changes, you can browse all of them - formerly this
hasn't been possible. Also, this now allows you to inspect every single upcoming
change before applying the Sync:

![Sync Preview - Details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/553008/191472900-1968691e-a758-4c99-99ce-059bc3689356.png)

This has been possible based on the code we implemented to support the
[Director Branches](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-director-branches/latest/)
module. In case you never heard about it,
[here](https://icinga.com/blog/2022/07/21/releasing-icinga-director-branches/)
you can find the related announcement.

This release also contains a lot of related fixes and new Features. It is now
possible to deal with **Service Sets** in Configuration Branches, the **commit
remark** can be proposed with a merge request, and the Activity Log shows not
only who has  merged the change, but also the **original author**.

Powerful new features have been implemented for those who love to orchestrate
the Director from the outside. Please check our
[CLI](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/blob/v1.10.0/doc/60-CLI.md)
and [REST API](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/blob/v1.10.0/doc/70-REST-API.md)
documentation for related details, especially look for --with-services (withServices)
and --allow-overrides (allowOverrides).

CLI now supports **JSON on STDIN**, REST API can request detailed stack traces
in case an error occurs.

### Configuration rendering
* FIX: Caching had an influence on context-specific Custom Variable rendering
  when those variables contained macros (#1257)

### Sync
* FIX: The fix for #1223 caused a regression and broke Sync for objects without
  a 'disabled' property (Sets, List members) (#1279)

### Fixed issues
* You can find issues and feature requests related to this release on our
  [roadmap](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/milestone/12?closed=1)

  even when no Sync Property `disabled` has been defined (#1223)
* FIX: Fix SQL error on PostgreSQL when inspecting Template-Choice (#1242)

### Large environments
* FIX: Director tries to raise it's memory limit for certain memory-intensive
  tasks. When granted more (but not infinite) memory however this had the effect
  that he self-restricted himself to a lower limit (#1222)

### User Interface
* FIX: Assignment filters suggested only Host properties, you have been required
  to manually type Service property names (#1207)
* FIX: Hostgroups Dashlet has been shown to users with restricted permissions,
  clicking it used to throw an error (#1237)

1.4.0
-----
### New requirements
* Icinga Director now requires PHP 5.4, support for 5.3 has been dropped
* For best performance we strongly suggest PHP 7
* When using MySQL, please consider slowly moving to at least version 5.5. One
  of our next versions will introduce official Emoji support 😱😱😱! That's not
  possible with older MySQL versions. However, 1.4.x still supports 5.1.x

### Fixed issues and related features
* You can find issues and feature requests related to this release on our
  [roadmap](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/milestone/6?closed=1)

### Dashboard and Dashlets
* Multiple new Dashboards have been introduced, their layout has been optimized
* Dashboards are made aware of newly introduced permissions and try to provide
  useful hints

### GUI, UX and Responsiveness
* Many little improvements related to mobile devices have been applied to
  Dashboards, Forms and Tables
* Search has been both improved and simplified. On most tables search spawns
  multiple columns, visible and invisible ones. Multiple search terms are
  combined in an intuitive way.
* Pagination (and search) has been added to those tables where it was still
  missing
* Some form fields referencing related objects are no longer static drop-down
  selection elements but offer suggestions as you type. This makes forms faster,
  especially in larger environments
* Navigation has been simplified, redirects after form submissions have been
  improved, more possibilities to jump to related objects have been added
* Form field description has been moved to the bottom of the screen. Might be
  easier to overlook this way, but while the former implementation was great
  for people navigating forms with their Keyboard, it was annoying for Mouse
  lovers
* Double-Click a Tab to enlarge it to full width
* Action Link bar has been unified, all links should now respect permissions
* All tables showing historic data are now grouped by day
* Property Modifiers, Sync Rules, Import Sources and more objects now offer
  description fields. This allows you to explain your colleagues all the magic
  going on behind the scenes

### Object Types
* Service Sets got quite some tweaking and bug fixing
* Groups of all kinds are now able to list their members, even when being
  applied based on filters
* Command Argument handling has been improved
* It is now possible to configure Dependencies through the Icinga Director
* Cloning Hosts now allows to also optionally clone their Services and Service
  Sets

### Templates
* The template resolver has been rewritten, is now easier to test, strict and
  faster
* Template Tree has been re-written and now also immediately shows whether a
  template is in use
* When navigating to a Template you'll notice a new usage summary page showing
  you where and how that specific template is being used. Therefor, many tables
  are now internally able to filter by inheritance

### Template Choices
* While Host- and Service-Templates are powerful building blocks, having to choose
  from a single long list might become unintuitive as this list starts growing.
  That's where Template Choices jump in. They allow you to bundle related Templates
  together and offer your users to choose amongst them in a meaningful way.

### Apply rules
* Various related issues have been addressed
* A new virtual "is true / is set" operator is now available

### Permissions and Restrictions
* It is now possible to limit access to Hosts belonging to a a list of Hostgroups.
  This works also for Hostgroups assigned through Apply Rules.
* Data List entries can be made available based on Roles

### Data Types
* SQL Query and Data List based Data Fields can now both be offered as Array fields,
  so that you can choose among specific options when filling such
* New overview tables give admins a deep look into used Custom Variables, their
  distinct values and usage
* Various issues related to Boolean values have been fixed

### Import and Synchronization
* Many issues have been addressed. Merge behavior, handling of special fields and
  data types
* Problems with Import Source deletion on PostgreSQL have been addressed
* New Property Modifiers are available. When importing single Services you might
  love the "Combine" modifier
* It is now possible to re-arrange execution order of Property Modifiers and
  Sync Properties
* Preview rendering got some improvements
* "Replace" policy on Custom Vars is now always respected
* Using VMware/vSphere/ESX? There is now a new powerful module providing a
  dedicated Import Source

### REST API
* A new Self Service API now allows to completely automate your Icinga Agent
  roll-out, especially (but not only) for Microsoft Windows
* List views are now officially available. They are very fast and stream the
  result in a memory-efficient way
* Documentation better explains how to deal with various objects, especially
  with different types of Services (!!!!!)

### Internal architecture
* Many base components have been completely replaced and re-written, based on
  and early prototype of our upcoming Icinga PHP Library (ipl)

### Fixed issues and related features
* You can find issues and feature requests related to this release on our
  [roadmap](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/milestone/10?closed=1)

### Apply Rules
* Slashes in Apply Rules have not been correctly escaped
* Services applied based on Arrays (contains) did not show up in the Hosts
  Services list, and therefor it was not possible to override their vars
* Some magic has been introduced to detect numbers in apply rules - not perfect
  yet

### Host Groups
* It has not been possible to modify Host Groups without defining an apply rule
* Hostgroups have not been sorted
* It is now legal to have `external` HostGroup objects

### Rendered Config
* Custom Endpoint objects are now rendered to their parent zone
* (Rendering) issues with the `in` operator have been fixed
* You are now allowed to put Notifications into specific Zones

### Usability and UI
* Selecting multiple hosts at once and deleting them had no effect
* Documentation got some little improvements
* German translation has been refreshed
* Header alignment has been improved
* Escaping issues with the Inspect feature have been addressed

### Kickstart

* Kickstart is more robust and now able to deal with renamed Icinga Masters and
  more

### CLI
* It is not possible to list and show Service Sets on the CLI

### Import and Sync
* Synchronizing Data List entries caused problems
* A new Import Modifier has been added to deal with LConf specialities
* Issues with special characters like spaces used in column names shipped by
  Import Sources have been addressed
* A new Property Modifier allows to filter Arrays based on wildcards or regular
  expressions
* A new Property Modifier allowing to "Combine multiple properties" has been
  introduced. It's main purpose is to provide reliable unique keys when importing
  single service objects.
* A new warning hint informs you in case you created a Sync Rule without related
  properties
* Synchronization filters failed when built with columns not used in any property
  mapping

### Auditing
* The audit log now also carries IP address and username

### Generic bug fixes
* Fixed erraneous loop detection under certain (rare) conditions
* Various issues with PHP 5.3 have been fixed
* Combination of multiple table filters might have failed (in very rare conditions)

1.3.1
-----

### Fixed issues and related features
* You can find issues and feature requests related to this release on our
  [roadmap](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/milestone/8?closed=1)

### Service Sets
* Various little issues have been fixed. You can now remove Sets from hosts,
  even when being empty. Services from Sets assigned to parents or via apply
  rule are now shown for every single host, and their custom vars can be
  overridden at a single host level
* Sets assigned to single hosts have been shown, variable overrides have been
  offered - but rendering did not include the Director-generated template
  necessary to really put them into place. This has been fixed

### Usability
* A nasty bug hindered fields inherited from Commands from being shown ad a
  Service level - works fine right now
* There is now a pagination for Zones
* Multiedit no longer showed custom fields, now it works again as it should

### Rendering
* Disabling a host now also disables rendering of related objects (Endpoint,
  Zone) for hosts using the Icinga Agent

### REST API
* Ticket creation through the REST API has been broken, is now fixed

### Performance, Internals
* A data encoding inconsistency slowed down apply rule editing where a lot of
  host custom vars exists
* Some internal changes have been made to make parts of the code easier to be
  used by other modules

1.3.0
-----

### Fixed issues and related features
* You can find issues and feature requests related to this release on our
  [roadmap](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/milestone/7?closed=1)

### Service Sets
* You are now allowed to create sets of services and assign all of them at
  once with an apply rule
* Sets can be assigned to host templates or directly to single hosts

### Service Variable Overrides
* When switching to a host view's services tab, you'll now not only see its
  very own services, but also ones that result from an apply rule
* You can override those services custom field values for every single host
* Same goes for services belonging to Service Sets

### Apply rules
* A new "contains" operator gives more possibilities when working with arrays
* Service vars are now also offered in the apply rule form wizard

### Custom Variables and Fields
* Issues with special characters in custom variables have been fixed
* In case mandatory fields should not have been enforced, this should work
  fine right now
* Fields can now be shown based on filter rules. Example use case: show a
  `Community String` field in case `SNMPv2` has been selected, but show
  five other fields for `SNMPv3`. This allows one to build powerful little
  wizard-like forms like shown [here](16-Fields-example-SNMP.md)

### Agents and Satellites
* It is now possible to set Agent and Zone settings on every single host. This
  means that you no longer need to provide dedicated Templates for Satellite
  nodes
* The proposed Agent Deployment script has been improved for Windows and Linux
* Infrastructure management got a dedicated dashboard
* Kickstart Wizard helps when working with Satellites. This has formerly been
  a hidden, now it can be accessed through the Infrastructure dashboard

### Commands
* Command arguments are now always appended when inheriting a template. This
  slightly changes the former behavior, but should mostly be what one would
  expect anyways.

### Testing
* [Testing instructions](93-Testing.md) have been improved
* Running the test suite has been simplified
* While we keep running our own [tests](93-Testing.md) on software platforms, tests
  are now also visible on Travis-CI and triggered for all pull requests

### Compatibility
* We worked around a bug in very old PHP 5.3 versions on CentOS 6

### Activity log
* You can now search and filter in the Activity log
* In case you have hundreds of thousands of changes you'll notice that pagination
  performance improve a lot
* A quick-filter allows you to see just your very own changes with a single click

### Deployment
* More performance tweaking took place. 1.2.0 was already very fast, 1.3.0 should
  beat it
* Deployment log got better at detecting files and linking them directly from the
  log output, in case any error occured

### Work related to Icinga 1.x
* Deploying to Icinga 1.x is completely unsupported. However, it works and a
  lot of effort has been put into this feature, so it should be mentioned here
* Please note that the Icinga Director has not been designed to deploy legacy
  1.x configuration. This is a sponsored feature for a larger migration project
  and has therefore been built in a very opinionated way. You shouldn't even
  try to use it. And if so, you're on your own. Nobody will help you when
  running into trouble

### Translation
* German translation is now again at 100%

### REST API
* Issues related to fetching object lists have been fixed

### Integrations
* We now hook into the [Cube](https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2-module-cube)
  module, this gives one more possibility to benefit from our multi-edit feature
* Icinga Web 2.4 caused some minor issues for 1.2.0. It works, but an upgrade to
  Director 1.3.0 is strongly suggested

1.2.0
-----

### Fixed a lot of issues and related features
* You can find issues and feature requests related to this release on our
  [roadmap](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/milestone/5?closed=1)

### Permissions and restrictions
* Permissions are now enforced. Please check your role definitions, permission
  names have changed and are now enforced everywhere
* Configuration preview, Inspect action, Deployment and others can be granted
  independently

### Auditing
* Director provides a nice activity log. Now it is also possible to additionally
  log to Syslog or File in case you want to archive all actions elsewhere. Access
  to the audit log in the Director can be controlled with a new permission

### Configuration kickstart
* Now imports also existing notification commands
* Kickstart can be re-triggered on demand at any time

### Performance
* Config rendering got a huge performance boost. In large environments we
  managed it to deploy a real-world configuration 5 times as fast as before

### Import / Sync
* Various improvements have been applied, mostly hidden small features that should
  make work easier. Better form field descriptions, more possibilities when it
  goes to syncing special fields like "imports"
* Property modifiers can now generate new modified columns at import time
* New property modifiers are available. There is a pretty flexible DNS lookup, you
  can cast to Integer or Boolean, JSON decoding and more is offered
* Datalist entries can now be imported and synchronized, this was broken in 1.1

### Configuration possibilities
* You can now define assign rules nested as deep as you want, based on all host
  and/or service properties
* It is now possible to define "assign for" constructs, looping over hashes or
  dictionaries
* Improved Icinga 2 DSL support in commands, implicit support for skip\_key
* More and more developers are contributing code. We therefore simplified the
  way to launch our unit tests and provided related documentation
* Other objects can be referred as a dropdown or similar in custom variables

### GUI and usability
* Form error handling got a lot of tweaking, eventual exceptions are caught in
  various places and presented in a readable way
* The deployment button is now easier to find
* Configuration preview has been improved and allows a full config diff even
  before deploying the configuration
* Inheritance loops are now shown in a nice way and can be resolved in the GUI
* A new hidden gem is the multiedit functionality. Press SHIFT/CTRL while
  selecting multiple hosts and modify imports, custom vars and other properties
  for all of them at once
* Errors or warnings in all historic startup logs now link directly to the
  related config file at the time being, pointing to the referred line

### Agent setup
* The Windows kickstart script got some small improvements and now enables all
  related ITL commands per default

### CLI
* You can find a few new commands, with the ability to list or fetch all hosts
  at once in various ways being the most prominent one

### Related modules
* There are now more additional modules implementing Director Hooks. AWS import
  for EC2 instances, ELBs and Autoscaling Groups. File import for CSV, JSON,
  YAML and XML. We heard from various successful Import source implementations
  in custom projects and would love to see more of those being publicly available!

1.1.0

### Fixed a lot of issues and related features
* You can find issues and feature requests related to this release on our
  [roadmap](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/milestone/4?closed=1)

### Icinga Agent handling
* A lot of effort has been put into making config deployment easier for
  environments with lots of Icinga Agents
* Related bugs have been fixed, the generated configuration should now work fine
  in distributed environments
* A customized Powershell Script for automatic Windows Agent setup is provided

### Apply Rules
* It's now possible to work with apply rules in various places

### Notifications
* All components required to deploy notifications are now available. ENV for
  commands is still missing, however it's pretty easy to work around this

### Automation
* Job Scheduler and Job Runner have been introduced. Import, Sync, Deploy and
  run Housekeeping in the background with full control and feedback in the GUI
* There is a new intelligent `purge` option allowing one to purge only those
  objects that vanished at involved Import Sources between multiple Import and
  Sync Runs.

### Data Types
* Booleans, Integers and Arrays are now first-class citizens when dealing with
  custom variables
