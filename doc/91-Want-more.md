================================

Icinga 2 configuration is a full-blown DSL, not just a configuration
format. It provides endless possibilities, the very same thing can
usually be accomplished in various ways. Director tries hard to offer
you as many of those as possible while strictly trying to keep things
simple.

You are absolutely right if you think that this might not be an easy
task. We do our best to give you as much flexibility as possible. In
case you miss a feature or have a cool idea of what else we could add
please let us know. Just file an issue or a feature request to our
issue tracker:

The Icinga project is and remains Open Source Software and lives from
community ideas and contributions.
